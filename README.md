# SMU-Doing-Data-Science-Project1
An analysis of the Beers data set which comprises 2410 US craft beers and 558 US breweries. 

A master codebook is provided as an Rmarkdown (.Rmd) file.  The final report knitted from the Rmd is included as a webpage (.html).  

Final presentation slides are included as a .pdf file that includes links to YouTube video presentations.  This file must be downloaded to access the YouTube links.  

All code files used to develop the final codebook are in the folder "Development Code"

All raw csv files are included in the main directory with the exception of beer_reviews.csv from Kaggle.  This file is too large for the GitHub account (>25 MB) and must be downloaded separately by the user at: https://www.kaggle.com/rdoume/beerreviews
